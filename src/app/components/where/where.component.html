    <h2>:is()-styled links</h2>
    <p class="description">
      The :is() CSS pseudo-class function takes a selector list as its argument,
      and selects any element that can be selected by one of the selectors in
      that list.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      This is useful for writing large selectors in a more compact form.

    <h2>:where()-styled links</h2>
    <p class="description">
      The :where() CSS pseudo-class function takes a selector list as its
      argument, and selects any element that can be selected by one of the
      selectors in that list.
    </p>
    <p class="description">
      The difference between :where() and :is() is that :where() always has 0
      specificity, whereas :is() takes on the specificity of the most specific
      selector in its arguments.
